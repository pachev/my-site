A year already?

What a year it has been. And you know what, where did the time go? As much fun as it has been,
I've also learned a few lessons along the way. Some were easy to chew, others; not so much! I plan
to make this an annual review to see what insights I draw as I progress. It will be fun to read 
these down the road. Well here they are in no particular order:

### A) Listen and learn

This isn't some major revelation; it's basically common sense. But I've noticed many developers, including
myself have a tendency to hear a problem and already start thinking about how best to begin tackling it. Even worse, we're 
already giving knee jerk answers before we've heard everything. I've also caught myself listening but not
learning anything from what I've just heard. Too often, I am already thinking of the response that I'll 
need to say.

One of the things I have learned from the [wizard][1] is to be calculated in my responses now. I don't 
always do this, but day by day, I am getting better. I've made it a point to actually listen, think, and 
then answer. That way the answer will be at least semi decent. This also applies to life, not just in
software development field. So, remember that it is OK to pause before answering.

### B) Hedge my expectations

What I mean by this is, what you hear and see others are doing is not necessarily what you'll be doing, nor
will it be what you should be doing. Just because your friends are using Kafka, running on Kubernetes, monitored
by IronChefer(I made that up) doesn't mean you'll need to do this as well.  I'm a serial side project starter
and new tech junkie. I found myself recommending tools that we had no need for. I'm glad I had others to help me
see the trap for what it really is.

### C) Stay curious and have fun

It is now my personal opinion that to remain relevant, you must also remain curious. I think that curiosity
is what drives most to this field. All the constant learning that we do, the deep dives into subjects that
will help us solve problems are due to curiosity. This also allows us to continue to learn. I find that it
is easy to spot those who have stopped being curious. 

Curiosity and enjoying what you do will naturally go hand in hand. Even as I sit and write this, I can believe
how incredibly lucky I am to wake up and work in what feels like a hobby and earn a living from it.

### D) Don't give exact dates

Oh, how I learned this one the hard way. Unless you're a contractor, don't be pressured into giving 
exact dates. It only took once for me to regret this, but I'm glad I learned it early on. The popular
advice out there on the interwebs is to double your estimate, when asked to give one.

### E) Don't take code reviews personally

You know, I feel like I'm a nice guy. So, I would always ask myself "why am I being picked on?" whenever
I saw a comment I disagreed on. But, I've come to realize not to take them personally anymore. Comments
such as "Why did you choose that variable name?" use to really annoy me, but now I brush them off. I've
realized that in person, these would normally be said in better tones but they may not come across the
same in text. Still, when I am commenting on code reviews, I always remember that another human is on
the other side of those comments. I think more of us would do well to learn this. However, I've learned
to no only not take these comments to heart but also that most developers are not really good at 
communicating.

### F) I'm still just an employee

It gets so easy for me  to fall into the trap of always trying to impress; it's just in my nature at this point. 
But realistically no matter how impressive your code and work ethic are, at the end of the day, you are an 
employee at a company. Even if you love creating software outside of work, you should actually spend those hours __outside__
of work. The first six months felt like I needed to prove something, but I've come to terms with it. I was 
even afraid to take PTO, but like everyone will tell you, taking a break is very important. Don't be afraid
an use all those perks (PTO and such) to enjoy work and life. Work-life balance is important for your mental health.

#### PS- Keep a work journal

Well that was all I highlighted for now in my work journal. Actually if I can give you a tip, it's to keep
a work journal. Write any and everything down you can while at work. That way you can:

1. account for your time
1. track your progress and decision making
